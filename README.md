# Open Quantum System Simulations 

This repository contains a series of comprehensive tutorials designed to help users understand and implement various simulation techniques for open quantum systems. Each tutorial is provided in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks to offer detailed explanations in both markdown and code comments.

## Tutorials Overview

1. **Numerical Simulation** - Introduction to numerical methods for simulating quantum systems on digital computers.
2. **Dilation of Kraus Operators** - Simulation using Kraus operators on IBM's QASM simulator.
3. **Generalized Quantum Master Equation (GQME)** - Implementation on both IBM's QASM simulator and real quantum machines.
4. **Unrestricted Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics (UAVQD)** - Advanced simulations for complex dynamical systems.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/quantum-simulation-tutorials.git
```

Navigate into each directory for detailed instructions and examples. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed to run the notebooks.

## Licensing

Each directory or notebook might have its own licensing. Please refer to the individual README files and notebooks within each directory for specific licensing information.

## Acknowledgments

This work is supported by references to significant publications, which can be found within each specific tutorial's directory.
