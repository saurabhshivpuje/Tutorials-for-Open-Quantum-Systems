# Numerical Simulation Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial introduces numerical simulation methods ideal for running trial examples on digital computers before employing quantum computing resources. These methods are suitable for systems with a manageable number of qubits.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in this directory.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to run various numerical simulations.

## Notebooks and Methods

- **spin-half-system.ipynb**: This notebook explains a simple Spin-1/2 system using two methods:
  1. **Qutip**: A Python package designed for quantum system simulations.
  2. **Matrix Multiplication Method**: A straightforward approach using direct matrix operations.
  
- **FMO-complex.ipynb**: Simulates the FMO complex using the Qutip method, showcasing how quantum dynamics can be modeled in more complex biological systems.

## Applicability

The methods demonstrated here, while powerful, are best used for systems with a smaller number of qubits due to computational limitations. They offer a good starting point for those new to quantum simulations.
